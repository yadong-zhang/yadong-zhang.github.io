I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu//cee/) at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu). My research focuses on developing *advanced computational methods* to facilitate *reliability and risk assessment* in various engineering disciplines. I have solid background in engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science, etc., and I extensively use *Bayesian inference*, *probabilistic modeling*, *stochastic optimization* and *neural networks* in my research. I am highly self-motivated and passionate to solve problems heads-on. I also enjoy teamwork and communicating with people from different cultural background.
