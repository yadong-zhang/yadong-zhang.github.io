This paper develops graph neural network (GNN) based surrogate model to ease the computational overhead of optimal power flow (OPF) and thus enable real-time risk quantification in power systems. A risk assessment framework that considers various failure modes at multiple levels (load shedding, transmission line overloading) is also developed.
